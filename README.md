# mosaan-clojure-rest-api

Sample REST API server based on Clojure.
This project's content based on [@lagenorhynque article on Qiita](https://qiita.com/lagenorhynque/items/b15689e5432e0170b172).

## Usage (in development, w/ VSCode & Remote-Containers extention.)

Thanks to VSCode `Remote-Containers` extention, you can just run `Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container` command.
Open command pallet in VSCode with `Ctrl + Shift + P`, then search and execute the command.
Now you can access the container in a VSCode terminal(`Ctrl + Shift + @`).
After opening the terminal run `lein` command.

```sh
lein run
```
